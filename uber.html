	<p> In the summer of 2017, I had the opportunity to intern as a Communication Designer in the Creative Marketing team at Uber. I work to develop new concepts for future marketing campaigns, as well as improve and expand upon existing campaign designs. These are selected work done during my three months at Uber. </p>

	<p> Everyday, millions of men and women risk their safety to protect our freedom and rights. As a result, many of our heroic veterans suffer from combat wounds that have made their lives harder. These challenges can include tasks such as driving, or having access to well equipped cars for wheelchairs. Uber has always been a strong supporter of our troops and military. We want say thank you by giving those who have served the country an alternative means of transportation. </p>

	<h1 class="postTitle" style=" color:#7cc8df; padding-top: 30px; "> Reflection </h1>

	<p> Walking into this internship, I did not expect that I would be creating content for a global audience.  </p>

	<img src="images/uber/reflection/reflection1.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 30;">

	<p> Unlike the typical internship impressions you get on TV, interns at Uber are expected to be doing the same level of work as full-time designers. Not only were we given the creative freedom to explore different directions, but our inputs were actually considered and recognized. As interns, we still get to pitch our ideas to the next person in the office, such as our creative director or design manager. </p>

	<p> One thing that I like about Uber is its flexibility in design. Since Uber is a relatively new “start up" compared to other established tech companies, flexibility regarding the brand’s image is still possible. This allowed me to explore a lot of different approaches in visual directions without being restricted to a strict guideline. I was constantly challenged to think outside the box and envision how the project could live outside of its brief, whether it would be an installation or a social activation. </p>

	<p> The most eventful time for me during the internship must have been my first two weeks at Uber. Two days into my internship, I was assigned to develop the design for a 48-feet billboard at YYC Airport in Canada. Five days into my internship, I sat two rows down from where David Bonderman made the infamous remark to Arianna Huffington that eventually made him step from the board. And at the end of the second week, Travis Kalanick decided to step down as the CEO of Uber. To my surprise, despite what the media has to say about Uber at this point, my immediate team was very supportive. After all of these big changes had happened so quickly, I began noticing a shift in how Uber presented itself as a company. Campaigns and paid media content started to change from rider acquisition focus to a more human centric/storytelling approach. Examples for this could be the <a href="https://www.uber.com/c/180-days/
	" target="_blank">180 Days of Change</a> campaign as well as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_NA2W5-vMs" target="_blank"> Ride to Remember </a> video for Father’s Day. </p>

	<p> One of the things that could be improved at Uber is the time and project management. I have always thought big companies like Uber would have prepared for a campaign months before. I was surprised to be invited into a “Fourth of July Brainstorm Session”, meeting 10 days before Fourth of July. This “lack” in planning, eventually, let me work on some incredible Uber campaigns. </p>



	<img src="images/uber/reflection/reflection4.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">

	<p> One of the most exciting things being an intern at Uber is getting a peek into what the future of transportation could look like. We got to listen to designers and engineers talk about autonomous cars and flying vehicles. On top of the wide range of products, Uber is constantly coming out with new ideas and products that make owning a personal car seem more impractical than practical (UberEats, UberFreight, etc.). </p>

	<p> Even though Uber has been my first internship experience, I left on a very positive note. I got to learn how the creative pipeline at a multi-billion dollar tech startup works, and see my design live and breath in the real world. </p>
