	<p> Halloween is the second busiest night for Uber, meaning there is ample opportunity to win the holiday for the brand. Each of the three campaigns accomplishes something different. The first is intentionally tongue and cheek to demonstrate product features and benefits in a playful way. The second creates an experiential element to delve into the many paths the night's festivities could take. And the final campaign looks to make waves with a massive execution. </p>

	<h1 class="postTitle" style=" color:#8848b2; padding-top: 30px; "> Tarot Helix Cards </h1>	
	<p> <b> Brief: </b> Whether it's the night you choose to have or the one fate chooses for you, no one knows exactly what's in the cards this Halloween. Except Uber. </p>
	<p> <b> Idea: </b> We'll create Uber tarot cards to determine the destiny of Uber riders no matter their destination. We'll create an in-app and physical experiences that reward riders with good fortune in the form of tarot card readings. </p>

	<p> <b> Brief: </b> Halloween is one of Uber's busiest nights and monsters might have something to do with it. </p>
	<p> <b> Idea: </b> We'll highlight the unique and supernatural use cases of monsters to underscore how easily we solve human needs 
	in comparison. We'll create content that spotlights monsters and the situations they need Uber most. </p>

	<p> As product demonstrations, we'll put Halloween creatures in situations to see how they use and interact with Uber. </p>

	<p> <b> Zombie </b> <br>
	 / :10-:30<br>
	[Stationary full shot] <br>
	Several haggard survivors enter the frame, fleeing something. They exit.<br>
	A zombie staggers into the frame reaching desperately ahead of himself.<br>
	ZOMBIE: OoooOOOOooooober<br>
	The zombie breaks character, stands upright, and reaches into his pocket
	for his phone. An Uber arrives seconds later and the zombie gets in.<br>
	DRIVER: Mint?<br>
	The zombie accepts and they're off after the survivors.
	</p>

	<p> <b> Werewolf </b> <br>
	 / :10-:30<br>
	[Extreme close up] <br>
	Werewolf begins howling, bathed in moonlight.<br>
	WEREWOLF: OwwwooooooOOooOOOOOOOOber <br>
	Zoom out to reveal werewolf was actually howling at the high beam light as his Uber pulls up.<br>
	Cut to driver looking at the human rider picture that no longer matches the transformed werewolf. <br>
	DRIVER: Um, Frank?<br>
	WEREWOLF: It's been a long night...<br>
	[End Card] CHOOSE OOOOOOOOBER THIS HALLOWEEN
	</p>

	<p> <b> Ghost </b> <br>
	 / :10-:30 <br>
	[Stationary full shot]<br>
	Three ghosts stand with baggage and their thumbs out, hitchhiking the old-fashioned way. Taxi cabs pass right through them.<br>
	A fourth ghost enters the shot with a smartphone in hand. He indicates it to the other ghosts.<br>
	GHOST: OOOOooooOOOooooooober<br>
	All ghosts echo the term in unison as an Uber rolls up.  They enter the vehicle, no doors needs. But the solid smartphone does not pass through and clatters to the ground<br>
	[End Card] CHOOSE OOOOOOOOBER THIS HALLOWEEN
	</p>



	<p> <b> Owl </b> <br>
	/ :10-30 <br>
	[Stationary full shot]<br>
	Two owls perch side by side in a tree at night.<br>
	OWL 1: Hoooh<br>
	OWL 2: Hooh Hooh<br>
	Car lights pass by underneath them.<br>
	OWL 1: Hoooooooooober<br>
	The second owl turns and looks quizzically at the other.<br>
