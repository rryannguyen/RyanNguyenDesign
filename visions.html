	<p> VISIONS is Brown/RISD's Asian and Asian American literary and visual arts magazine. Working as the designer for VISIONS, my responsibilities consist of layout editing, designing the brand identity and merchandise including stickers, tote bags, sweaters, and posters. </p>	

	<h2> Layout </h2>

	<p> "VISIONS is a publication that celebrates the diversity of Brown and RISD's Asian/Asian American community. We are committed to being an open literary and artistic forum for Asians and Asian Americans, as well as other members of the university community, to freely express and address issues relating to both the Asian and Asian American experience. VISIONS further serves as a forum for issues that cannot find a voice in other campus publications. As a collaborative initiative, VISIONS attempts to strengthen and actively engage Brown and RISD's vibrant community of students, faculty, staff, and alumni, as well as the larger Providence community". </p>

	<p> The primary challenge for VISIONS is how do we layout each page so that it serves as the best canvase to showcase student's work. Even though each submission is sent in separately, the writing and artwork are carefully paired together in each spread. Other important design components we have to consider are providing a solid grid system for the layout, picking out the most appropriate typefaces, and establishing a clear hierarchy through the page. The VISIONS team had also reached out to Tiffany Chiu, an Illustration student, to create the cover that best represents the values of our publication. </p>

	<h2> Branding </h2>

	<p> In the beginning of every semester, VISIONS sends out a call for submissions to students. And towards the end of every semester, VISIONS hosts a release party to give out copies of the magazine as well as live performances from the Brown and RISD community. So through out the year, I designed posters and goodies (stickers, tote bags, etc.) for these events.  </p>

	<h2> Website Prototype </h2>

	<p> I designed the wireframe and coded a mockup website for VISIONS, providing VISIONS its own platform to upload content besides Facebook or Instagram. </p>
