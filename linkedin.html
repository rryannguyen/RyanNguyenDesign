	<p> This case study is not currently published on my website. It can only be accessed through the link provided. </p>	

	<p> <b> Introduction </b> <br> 
	LinkedIn is frequently used for job hunting. Companies pay to post a job, and market their opportunities to qualified candidates. LinkedIn job seekers may search for jobs through keywords, company pages, or via their network of connections.</p>

	<p> <b> Prompt </b> <br> 
	Design an improved job posting experience for recruiters or hiring managers, that helps them attract and recruit relevant candidates for the position.</p>

	<p> <b> Scope </b> <br> 
	Please think through the end to end experience, and share your thought process, approach, insights and analysis with us. However, we want to limit the scope of the final deliverable to one high-fidelity design comp that demonstrates your interaction and visual design capabilities. </p>

	<p> <b> LinkedIn's Mission Statement: </b> Connect the world’s professionals to make the more productive and successful </p>

	<p> With this slogan in mind, LinkedIn should set up the candidates for success, starting from the job post. </p>


	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Goals</b> </p>

	<p>Before diving into the research process, I spent some time setting goals I want to achieve in this one week design challenge: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Understand the passive and active applicant’s thought process when it comes to job seeking  </li>
		<li>Identify main competitors and how LinkedIn could leverage its existing features to differentiate itself from the market </li>
		<li>Make the job posting experience more inclusive for smaller companies or new recruiters that don’t necessarily have much experience in recruiting</li>
		<li>Update the UI of the job posting experience to match the current LinkedIn’s general interface </li>
		<li>Deliver a thoughtful and polished redesign for LinkedIn’s job posting experience </li>
	</ul>

	<figcaption> Research pipeline  </figcaption> </figure>


	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Online Research</b> </p>

	
	<p>For my first step, I want to break down the prompt to truly understand the end goal of this assignment. I did a walkthrough of the current job posting experience on LinkedIn and various job boards several times to have a grasp of what the experience is generally like. </p>

	<p>Understanding the target audience is essential for this redesign. In this case, even though the redesign users are recruiters, the target audience that we want to attract would be the candidates/job seekers. So in order to help the recruiters attract and recruit relevant candidates, I want to understand what a potential candidate’s thought process is like when they look for jobs.  </p>

	<p>I started my research process with gathering information and statistics for recruiting from various sources. The most helpful sources for understanding recruiting and candidates are from LinkedIn itself. The four documents that I used are: </p>

	<p>
	<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf" target="_blank">The Ultimate Hiring Statistics </a><br>
	<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/resources/pdfs/inside-the-mind-of-todays-candidate.pdf" target="_blank">Inside the Mind of Today’s Candidate </a> <br>
	<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/job-switchers/PDF/job-switchers-global-report-english.pdf" target="_blank">Why & How People Change Jobs </a><br>
	<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruitment-tool-reviews#all" target="_blank">Case studies from LinkedIn Talent Solutions</a>
	</p>

	<p>Through these documents, as well as various online sources, I had a glimpse into how recruiting can be done effectively, as well as the active job seeker’s thought process going through job boards. </p>

	

	
	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>User Research Survey</b> </p>

	<p> To further confirm my fingdings from online research, I wanted to get the answers to my questions from actual people I know around me. I sent out a survey to twenty people, anyone from students to active professionals in order to really learn how they approach the job seeking process.</p>

	<p>In the survey, I want to find out: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>What is the highest degree have you have achieved or actively pursuing? </li>
		<li>Are you actively looking for a new job/internship?</li>
		<li>How do you learn about new job opportunities?</li>
		<li>Where do you get information to prepare for interviews? </li>
		<li>What appeal to you the most in an online job post? (select 4)</li>
		<li>How often are the job opportunities suggested to you through LinkedIn relevant to what you want to do?</li>
		<li>What do you like/dislike about LinkedIn when it comes to job search?</li>
		<li>Are there any alternative options besides LinkedIn that you use for job search?</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="images/linkedin/survey3.png" style="width:80%;">
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19A7sGAqdXbgJJhvU2VZ3gMujQYTi86iDTuAzaHfatJA/viewanalytics" target="_blank" >See all 20 survey responses here </a></p>



	<p> I also tried to reach out to recruiters I have worked with to set up user interviews, but none had time to meet within a few days notice. However, I have already written out questions I want to ask if I could get in touch with a recruiter: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Have you ever posted a job on LinkedIn? </li>
		<li>How often do you post jobs on LinkedIn?</li>
		<li>Are there any features that you hope to have in job posting experience through LinkedIn? </li>
		<li>How do you decide how much to spend on a daily budget? </li>
		<li>In your recruiting experience, what are some of the most appealing qualities that you try to promote to attract potential candidates? </li>
		<li>Besides LinkedIn, what are other ways you reach potential candidates? </li>
		<li>Are there any features that you hope to have in job posting experience? </li>

	</ul>

	<p>So just by using the information I gathered from the research survey, as well as information I collected from online research, I approached affinity mapping in order to identify any pattern or potential areas we could explore. The breakdown and analysis of my finding will be shown below in the Information Synthesis section. </p>


	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Usability Testing/Current Interface Analysis</b> </p>

	<p> Essential to any redesign, the designers have to understand what the issues are with the current design in order to improve upon it. I asked three volunteers to pretend like they are a recruiter uploading a job post on LinkedIn for the first time. </p>

	<p> <b> Prompt </b> <br> 
	You’re a recruiter who has never uploaded a job post on LinkedIn before. Please navigate from the LinkedIn homepage to upload a job post. You are encouraged to speak aloud your thought process as you navigate through the task. 
	</p>

	<p> <b> Findings </b> <br> 
		For the most part, the participants did not find it hard to navigate to LinkedIn Jobs since they could spot the “Post a Job” tab pretty easily. Overall, the job posting process was very straight forward, and the users did not encounter any big pain points. However, throughout usability tests, the participants and I were able to identify some minor problems with the current experience:

	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Competitive Analysis</b> </p>

	<p> Based on my survey, I found out the most common alternative choice besides LinkedIn for job search is Glassdoor. When asked, the users said they liked Glassdoor because its job posts offer insights into the salary range submitted by other users, as well as ratings and reviews submitted by past employees. Because Glassdoor’s known as the main platform for current and former employees to submit anonymous reviews of their companies, Glassdoor could use the data collected to add an extra edge to their job posts. With this in mind, I was thinking about how LinkedIn could leverage its popular professional network into the job posts in order to recruit more relevant candidates. </p>

	<figure> <img src="images/linkedin/glassdoor.png"> 
	<figcaption> Glassdoor uses user's reviews and insights to add an edge to their job posts  </figcaption> </figure>


	<p>Other competitors include Indeed and ZipRecruiter share the job posting method without charge. </p>



	<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;" id="affinitymapping"><b>Information Synthesis</b> </p>

	<p> I began the affinity mapping process in order to synthesize all of these information. Through affinity mapping, I want to be able to further narrow down to scope of this project and identify an opportunity area the redesign could benefit from. I broke down the information into these categories: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jobs outreach </li>
		<li>Interview Prep Information </li>
		<li>Job appeals </li>
		<li>Likes/Dislikes of current LinkedIn </li>
		<li>Alternative platforms/competitors </li>
	</ul>


	<figure> <img src="images/linkedin/af1.jpg" style="width: 120%; margin-left: -100px; margin-right: -100px;"> 
	<figcaption> I used affinity mapping to synthesize the information and identify any opportunity area</figcaption> </figure>

	<p> Using information collected from online research, user survey, usability testing, and competitive analysis, I was able to get the answers to my original questions through affinity mapping. </p>

	<p> <b> How do candidates hear about new opportunities? </b> <br> 
		People who work in the same industry usually know each other, thus, by promoting and targeting candidates within that person’s network, the job post will be promoted to more relevant candidates. <br>
		Referrals are the top source of quality hires, and is one of the most popular ways people discover new jobs.  <br>
		Alumni network and school’s career portals also are also a popular choice.
	</p> 

	<p> <b> How do candidates get information for interviews? </b> <br> 
		<img src="images/linkedin/survey1.png">
		According to my survey, most people go to the company’s websites to learn information about the company. By adding a quick access link to the company’s website, it could be a faster and easier way for prospective candidates to learn about the company.
	</p> 

	<p> <b> What appeals to the candidates in a job post? </b> <br> 
		<img src="images/linkedin/survey2.png">
		Although company’s culture is ranked as the third most important appeal in my research, users have to scroll all the way down to spot the company’s profile in the current LinkedIn’s job post. By intergrating this information into job post, it could improve the recruiter's company brand image and attract more relevant candidates who relate to the company’s mission and culture. 
	</p> 

	<p> <b> What are the likes and dislikes of the current interface? </b> <br> 
		Most people like how they could see who in their network is currently working at that company.   <br>
		The most common dislike about applying for job through LinkedIn is the users do not know how to keep track of their applications. Another common dislike for LinkedIn is that it’s not great for smaller companies, startup, or studios since a lot of advertised and big companies come up first on the job board.
	</p> 

	<p> <b> What are the alternative platforms/competitors for job search? </b> <br> 
		As mentioned above, the most common alternative for job search besides Linkedin is Glassdoor. 
	</p> 

	<!--	<p> After processing all of the infomration, I provided a more specific scope for the prompt through a persona: </p>

	<img src="images/linkedin/persona.png" style="width: 80%;"> -->



	<div id="ideation"> 

	<h1 class="postTitle" style=" color:#0077B5; padding-top: 30px; "> IDEATION </h1>


	<p>I approached the ideating phrase knowing that I don’t need to do an end to end redesign since the current flow proved to be working really well already based on the usability tests. However, I think it would be beneficial to make tweaks to the current design and add features in order to achieve the goal of getting more relevant candidates through the job post.</p>

	<img src="images/linkedin/sketchlp.jpg" style="width: 80%;">
	<p>The LinkedIn Job’s landing page is the first impression the recruiter have with the experience. On the current design, once the recruiter comes on the page, the only elements that are visible are the Job Post box and a quote. As a result, it doesn’t encourage the recruiters to scroll down to see the rest of the page, even though the value props are located at the bottom of the page. Even if the recruiter reaches the bottom of the page, there’s not CTA that encourages the recruiters to post a job. With that said, in my redesign, I want to emphasized the UI aspect on the landing page. Through visual elements, I want to highlight LinkedIn Job’s effectiveness and create trust. </p>

	<p> During my ideating phrase, I noticed that there are different wording to the same word (i.e. responsibilities, essential duties, position purpose) on the job posts. That’s why I also explored the idea of separating job responsibilities, qualifications, and company’s information into different input boxes in order to create a more unified language. This way, the job seekers can process the information faster and easier. However, since the recruiters will probably have to copy and paste the same information to various job boards, separating this information will create a pain point that did not exist in the first place. Therefore, I did not move forward with this idea. </p>

	<img src="images/linkedin/sketchflow.jpg" style="width: 80%;">

	<p>The current job posting experience is pretty straight forward. However, the intention for separating the three steps is not clear enough for the users. Additionally, the Budget page and Payment page are separated from each other even though they share similar information. As a result, I reorganized all of the information into three categories: About the Job, About the Candidate, Budget and Payment. This way, the recruiters will have clearer idea of how the information is organized through out the experience. </p>

	

	<figure> <img src="images/linkedin/sketchall.jpg" > 
	<figcaption> Information are organized into three categories: Job, Candidate, and Payment</figcaption> </figure>



	<p>
	Because recruiting is more effective when there’s a personal aspect, I made the copy of the job posting experience more conversational, queuing the recruiters to have their copy the same way (i.e. “What job do you want to post?” to “Tell us about the job”). I also included a Review page as two out of three participants for my usability tests mentioned they want to review all of the information before purchasing the job post.  </p>

	<p>One of the key features of the redesign is how to utilize LinkedIn’s professional network in order differentiate itself from other job boards. According to LinkedIn’s Hiring Statistics "companies can expand their talent pool by 10x by recruiting through their employees’ networks”, and referrals are a top source of quality hires. Additionally, the user survey research informed me that LinkedIn is not great for smaller companies, startups, and studios. The reason for this is because a lot of big companies could pay for advertisement to put their job posts on top. As a result, I came up with a feature that could ask people in your network to give out referrals indirectly. </p>

	<img src="images/linkedin/sketchcandidate.jpg" id="verticalIMG">

	<p>On the About the Candidate page, the recruiters can promote the job post to a target connection’s network. This feature will give the recruiters suggestions of whose network to target, and the suggestions is based on people in the recruiter's network that has the same title as the job post. And since people who work in the same industry usually know each other, by promoting and targeting candidates within that person’s network, the job post will reach to a more relevant pool of candidates. </p>

	<h1 class="postTitle" style=" color:#0077B5; padding-top: 30px; "> CONCLUSION </h1>

	<p>I was very worried when I first got this assignment for several reasons. Although I’m a frequent user of LinkedIn, I am not familiar with the recruiting and job posting process through it. Additionally, I don’t know many recruiters or hiring managers who could help with my user research interviews. But as I approached the research part of my process, I found a lot of resources and information that I could use to bypass the lack of direct user research for recruiters. </p>

	<p>Although I received an email from Indeed with the note "your employer account has been disabled”, I had so much fun throughout this process I thought it was worth it.</p>
